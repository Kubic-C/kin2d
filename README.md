# kin2d
A fast, extremely lightweight, box/tile physics engine

This engine is the physics engine for Spock Engine.
Everything in this engine is meant to make physical computation for boxes extremely fast.

This includes:
- Tile bodies which are composed of boxes
- Intuitive physics simulation

While this physics engine is capable of simulating boxes extremely fast, it can't handle anything other then rectangles.
