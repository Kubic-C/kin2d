# kin2d
A fast, extremely lightweight, box/tile physics engine

This engine is the physics engine for Spock Engine.
Everything in this engine is meant to make physic computation for boxes extremely fast.

This includes:
- Tile bodies which are composed of boxes
- Intuitive physics simulation

While this physic engine is capable of simulating boxes extremely fast, there is a cost.
Kin2d cannot handle polygons that arent boxes.
